Title:
Data Science Pipeline for End-to-end Advanced Clinical Decision Support System

Abstract:
The rapid growth of electronic health records (EHRs) and the increasing availability of clinical data have created new opportunities for developing advanced clinical decision support systems (CDSS). These systems can assist healthcare providers in making quick, informed decisions by leveraging the power of data science and machine learning techniques. By using the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR databases, we aim to develop a comprehensive data science pipeline for an end-to-end advanced CDSS, focusing on the early detection and risk assessment of sepsis, a life-threatening condition. Our project utilizes a ResNet-50 CNN model to detect lung anomalies from chest X-ray images. We combine the output of the ResNet model with patient data to build another model that estimates the likelihood of developing sepsis within specific time frames.
